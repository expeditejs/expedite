# Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are very welcome. If you are using this app and fixed a bug or improve it, please consider submitting a PR!

If you want to contribute you must read and accept out [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)

## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- The master branch is where incoming new features are merged (the next coming release).
- All new features / bugs should be done in dedicated branch from the `master` branch.
- It's a very nice thing to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. It's easier to review it. Then we will squash it before merging.

### Commit messages

This project uses commit names as commit convention, because it's fun and provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit by a short message explaining the update. You can also add a description if it's needed. That's all ;)

### Adding new feature

Ideally you should open a suggestion issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/expeditejs) or chat with the community on [Slack]().
